This is the Volunteer Event Registration Module.
As an administrator you will be able to
1. set the Registration Event
2. set the default number of volunteers per event.
3. set the name for the concomitant/corollary photo gallery

Stations are created separately and independently.

The registration form allows the volunteer to select stations.
The chair has the added ability of assign a volunteer and selecting
stations on her behalf.

Only a single registration may be saved per volunteer per event.

Closed stations can not be selected.

Code needs to be added to prevent 'data save conflict'
